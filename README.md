Crystal Guessing Game

The game starts with displaying a random number between 19 and 120.

There are 4 crystals on the page. Each has a specific mystery value for 1 to 12. This value will remain constant throughout the duration of a single game.

Click on a crystal to add it's value to your score. Guess the value of each crystal by watching what it adds to your score. 

The goal is to add crystal values until you reach the the total of the random number without going over. You can take as many tries as you need to reach the number.

If you match the value of the number the game ends and you win. If you go over the number the game ends and you lose.

Once the game is over, the game values will reset with a new random number to match and the values of each crystal will change.
